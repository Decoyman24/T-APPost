    Parola(nome: "Ue", descrizione: #"The equivalent to Ue is "Hey", you can use it in different forms such as "ue ue" for a more informal approach or with a more serious tone as if "Hey now".

If it’s used as an affirmation it means that everything is fine, there is nothing to worry about. On the other hand, if it’s used as a question, it can either mean to genuinely ask if a person is ok, or to sarcastically ask if the person in question is serious during an argument."#, esempio: #"Example: "- Ue fra tutto bene? | - Si fra’ tutt’ apposto". "- Ehi bro everything ok? | - Yeah, everything is fine"#, categoria: "Greetings"),

    Parola(nome: "A’ Maronna t’accumpagna", descrizione: #"Literally translated with "Wish you could walk without worries and blessed by Virgin Mary’s light". Historically it refers to the fact that when in Naples there was no electricity, in 1700, only the lights from the little shrines of the Virgin Mary along the roads could lead the way for the people of the city.

Today it is used, in general, to wish someone a good journey or return home."#, esempio: #"Example: "- Domani partirò per Roma | - Ch'a Maronna t'accumpagna". "- Tomorrow I'll leave for Rome | - (...)""#, categoria: "Daily Life"),
    
    Parola(nome: "Duje euro a piacere", descrizione: #"Regular and frequent way for unauthorized , most of the time, park-guy to ask for payment. Literally it means "Two euros to your convenience". The idea of referring to a person, even someone you don’t know, with "doctor" is a sign of respect.

"Doctor, two euros to your convenience, it's for my sons!""#, categoria: "Daily Life"),

    Parola (nome: "Cazz' e cucchiara", descrizione: #"Literally "thrower and spoon". There is also a wrong belief that it derives from "cup and spoon". Although the meaning is similar, the correct etymology is the first one. The saying is commonly used joined with the expression "site cazz e cucchiara" which means "you two are like thrower and spoon", it usually express an idea of connection and closeness between two people, most of the time not romantic. The equivalent in English is "two peas in a pod"."#, esempio: #"Example: "Chilli duje paren cazz' e cucchiara" "They looks like thrower and spoon""#, categoria: "Daily Life"),
    
    Parola(nome:"Ue bambola/Ue ciuciù", descrizione: #"Literally "Hey sweetie".

    Parola(nome:"Fiuuuuuu *whistling*", descrizione: #"Called also catcalling. Usually done by the local wildlife ('cuozzo'). We think it’s also important to underline the fact that the whistle is a form of communication itself: the longer the whistle, the serious the topic/reaction/accusation."#, esempio: #"Example: "- Comm me sta stu vestito? | - *whistling*" "- Comm me sta stu vestito? | - *whistling*""#, categoria: "Romance"),
    
    Parola(nome:"Sij 'na preta", descrizione: #"Literally translated with "You are a stone", although it means "you're hot as hell". The most classic of compliments, yet a little bit trashy, to woo a partner.

    Parola(nome:"Jammo a pustiggià", descrizione: #"Literally "let’s go make a pusteggia". The pusteggia in Neapolitan could be seen as a reinterpretation of the idea of courtship when a potential suitor gets closer to his love interest and begins a conversation. The pusteggia is commonly done by a group of 4/5 friends whose objective for the night is to meet girls. Example: when you are out with your friends and you want to meet new people? You go making pustegge."#, esempio: #"Example: "Uagliù stasera jammo a pustiggià" "Guys this evening we'll hookup""#, categoria: "Romance"),
    
    Parola(nome:"A' sola 'ngann", descrizione: #"Literally "sole in the throat". Even though the expression could sound aggressive and violent, in reality is pretty romantic; it means a kiss with the use of the tongue. Analyzing the element we can see a clear connection between sola-sole-tongue and n’gann-throat. The ‘violence’ of the saying tends to highlight the passion that permeates through the kiss."#, esempio: #"Example: "C'aggia rat na sola 'ngann" "I had a passionate French kiss""#, categoria: "Romance"),
    
    Parola(nome:"A' pelle", descrizione: #"Literally "the skin". There are variations such as "Fatte 'na pelle" which means literally "Do a skin". The real meaning of the expression is "Go and have sex". This expression derives directly from latin: in fact "pellex" in latin means "prostitute", so if we wanted to consider it's literal etymology it would mean "...to have sex with a prostitute"."#, esempio: #"Example: "Ieri sera c'amma fatt na pell" "Yesterday evening we had sex""#, categoria: "Romance"),
    
    Parola(nome:"[Speaker 1]: Yo! [Speaker 2] Che're che yo!", descrizione:#"Literal translation not available. USE WITH CAUTION. "Yo" is catalogued as a war-cry. Usually when yelled a gang fight could start. The first part of the expression is an invite for a potential opponent. When a second speaker responds with the second come-back then he implicitly accepted to fight. The expression is very used in the suburban area of Giugliano, around Naples. We highly suggest not to use this expression if you are not ready for a fight."#, esempio: #"Example: I think it's clear enough."#, categoria:"Danger Zone"),
    
    Parola(nome:"Staje guardann?!", descrizione:#"Literally translated with “Are you looking at me?!” It’s a confrontational sentence usually used to lead the other person to quarrel with you. A variation of the sentence can be “Staje guardann a' guagliona mia?” which translates as “Are you looking at my girlfriend?!”. The Neapolitan man is a really possessive one, so we recommend not to engage. Even if you are right, just ignore them."#, esempio: #"Example: "Oh fra ma staje guardann?" "Hey bro are you staring at me?""#, categoria:"Danger Zone"),
    
    Parola(nome:"Oh ma che're?", descrizione:#"Literally translated with “Hey, what do you want from me?”. It’s a very rude way to pick a fight with someone, but it can also be used as an answer when someone is harassing you or pissing you off."#, esempio: #"Example: "Oh ma che're? Tien cocc problema?" "Hey, what do you want from me? Do you have a beef with me?""#, categoria:"Danger Zone"),
    
    Parola(nome:"Ue uagliò, bellu 'rilogg.", descrizione:#"It means “Hey, what a nice watch you have“. Usually you would be flattered by a compliment, but in this case they just want to rob you. Run."#, esempio: #"Example: Look at your wrist ;)"#, categoria:"Danger Zone"),
    
    Parola(nome:"Puos e' sord.", descrizione:#"Literal invite to "hand over your monetary possessions", it's kinda clear what's going on. You're being mugged."#, esempio: #"Example: "Statt zitt e puos e' sord!" "Shut up and give me your money!""#, categoria:"Danger Zone"),
    
    Parola(nome:"Amma piglià questione?!", descrizione:#"Literally "Are you looking for troubles?!".  If you find yourself at this point in a conversation, maybe something has gone wrong.
